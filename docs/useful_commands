PSQL (greenplum): 

**Always gpstop before leaving/rebooting/shutting down, and gpstart to restart the database.** 
**Do not hard reboot Magellan instance without first running GPSTART.**

Listings: 
\d - lists tables, views, sequences \d table_name shows description of table
\du - list of roles (users and groups)
\dt - list tables, also shows schemas
\dv - list views
\l - lists all databases
\dn - list schemas

\d [object_name] - **will show data types for each column**

Accessing Database: 
\c - connect to a new database
\q - quit database

Help: 
\h - help on syntax for SQL command \h SELECT or \h *
\?  - list psql commands


Utility: 
\timing [on | off] - toggles timing commands
\cd - change working directory
\i - runs SQL script from inside database 

FROM TERMINAL:
psql -l - list all available databases
psql -U username db - connects user to db

example: `psql -d crimes -h gpMaster -p 5432 -U gpadmin` (-d database, -h host, -p port, -U user)

ps -ef | grep gpfdist : helpful to see if gpfdist is running

telnet ip port : better than pinging to check reachability

netstat -tanpu ; display processes at each port

Running `gpfdist`: gpfdist -d /home/centos -p 8081 -l ./log/ &;
note `-d /home/centos` is what the the machine with the external table will connect to, (will be it's starting address)

lsof -i:8081; helpful for listing the `PID` of the process running on the port; useful for terminating `gpdfidst`
