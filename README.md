### Recommendations:   
---  
We recommend starting with the [tutorial] (tutorial/GENERAL.md).  
This will provide you with a quick introduction to the system.    

Then, review the installation documents. Start with the [general install](https://github.com/syuja/GreenPlumSetup/blob/master/inst/INSTALLATION.md).   
Most importantly, view the [requirements](https://github.com/syuja/GreenPlumSetup/blob/master/inst/Installation_Recap.md) and installing on [master](https://github.com/syuja/GreenPlumSetup/blob/master/inst/Master_Install.md).  
This will help you avoid common installation issues and save time.   

Also, take time to view the [configuration](https://github.com/syuja/GreenPlumSetup/blob/master/inst/config/CONFIGURATION.md) files in order to see how our Greenplum instance was configured.  

You may wish to view [helpful commands](https://github.com/syuja/GreenPlumSetup/blob/master/docs/HelpfulCommands.md) as a reference, as you begin to use the Greenplum database and  
start adding datasets to it.
